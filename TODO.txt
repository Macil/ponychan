make inline editing user server endpoint which checks userhash, not password

filter edit page
- show stats about number of times the filter has been hit
- maybe show some post bodies of posts blocked by the filter
- during edit:
  - show current posts which would have been affected by the filter
  - have a post form that people can test filters against

- add separate column storing whether an image is a spoiler or deleted
if a user is suspected of being a bot (first time user, making a thread)
- put their post in the queue if they have no posts in the queue
- flag them such that they must solve a captcha before being able to post again
rotating captcha

selenium tests
put "last edited timestamp" column in posts tables
fix "nothing to edit" message when trying to edit ancient post
site settings table
one posts table instead of one table per board
better ban screen
[rawhtml]
let (mod?) editing (un)spoiler a post. (need to generate/remove thumbnail)
mod controls on IP page? need progress indicator
[D++] is slow
how do post updates work with previews?
#unread is broken on mature threads
keep mods logged in

- separate out tinyboard code and all instance files (config files, cache, board
  html and image files) so deploys can finally be as easy as rsyncing the core/
  directory over.
- ban signing, move signing. Add column for moderator names to mod
  table. Tripcode output should be included, not tripcode passwords.
- post dropdown menu with [#cyclic] option

/all/ with tag filters and sorting order options
Require spoilered threads to have a subject
timed deletion board. (Threads that haven't been bumped in a set amount of time are pushed off?)
make moving a thread to a board it already exists on cause an error

# mod tools
allow disabling the board sorting of posts on IP page
Search by name/trip/filename pagination
page showing posts by new users
Mods having access to the blotter

investigate antibot
fix cache consistency

fix moving thread resetting thread bump date to OP date (?)
make reply queuing a toggleable setting that defaults to off

post drop-down buttons

view deleted posts
- image filename is renamed so old URL stops working
persist deleted threads and posts
- allow mods to see (with [deleted] in the post header bright red maybe)
- allow mods to revert
- include threads that were recently pushed off of the board

/all/
- json api
- static page that uses ajax and react

thread tags and board thread filter toggle buttons

separate name cookie on anon
/anon/: make name field default to blank
- dropdown for remembered names+trips? https://helgesverre.com/blog/textbox-dropdown-html5/

Remove [D+] button, rename [D++] to [D+]
- "Delete all posts by IP on one board" is not useful enough to exist and take
  screen space on every post.

themes page for users to see screenshots of all themes at once
- maybe just iframes of the actual site showing the themes. (Can you use css to
  zoom an iframe?)

Use Content-Security-Policy headers
- need to phase out all inline javascript and javascript: links
- put some side channel for mods/admins to put scripts with posts besides just
  having the script in the post html
