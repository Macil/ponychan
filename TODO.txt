staff: replace "promote"/"demote" buttons with a simple radio button menu on user edit page.

watcher should support reports

-themes

post drop-down buttons

#mature posts

mod interface love

persist deleted threads and posts
- allow mods to see (with [deleted] in the post header bright red maybe)
- allow mods to revert
- include threads that were recently pushed off of the board

ban appeals

/all/
- json api
- static page that uses ajax and react

thread tags and board thread filter toggle buttons

/anon/: make name field default to blank
- dropdown for remembered names+trips? https://helgesverre.com/blog/textbox-dropdown-html5/

moderator capcode checkbox
- the "remember to put ' ## Mod' after your name" thing is pretty silly

Remove [D+] button, rename [D++] to [D+]
- "Delete all posts by IP on one board" is not useful enough to exist and take
  screen space on every post.

AJAX for moderator actions
- should be able to delete a post or ban a user without leaving the thread.

themes page for users to see screenshots of all themes at once
- maybe just iframes of the actual site showing the themes. (Can you use css to
  zoom an iframe?)

Use Content-Security-Policy headers
- need to phase out all inline javascript and javascript: links
- put some side channel for mods/admins to put scripts with posts besides just
  having the script in the post html
