- improved post rate limiting: user currently can't make two posts in under 10
  seconds. Should be able to configure additional limits such as a limit for how
  many threads can be made in an hour, etc.

- separate out tinyboard code and all instance files (config files, cache, board
  html and image files) so deploys can finally be as easy as rsyncing the core/
  directory over.
- ban signing, move signing. Add column for moderator names to mod
  table. Tripcode output should be included, not tripcode passwords.
- post dropdown menu with [#cyclic] option

/all/ with tag filters and sorting order options
Require spoilered threads to have a subject
timed deletion board. (Threads that haven't been bumped in a set amount of time are pushed off?)

-themes

post drop-down buttons

#mature posts

persist deleted threads and posts
- allow mods to see (with [deleted] in the post header bright red maybe)
- allow mods to revert
- include threads that were recently pushed off of the board

ban appeals

/all/
- json api
- static page that uses ajax and react

thread tags and board thread filter toggle buttons

/anon/: make name field default to blank
- dropdown for remembered names+trips? https://helgesverre.com/blog/textbox-dropdown-html5/

Remove [D+] button, rename [D++] to [D+]
- "Delete all posts by IP on one board" is not useful enough to exist and take
  screen space on every post.

themes page for users to see screenshots of all themes at once
- maybe just iframes of the actual site showing the themes. (Can you use css to
  zoom an iframe?)

Use Content-Security-Policy headers
- need to phase out all inline javascript and javascript: links
- put some side channel for mods/admins to put scripts with posts besides just
  having the script in the post html
